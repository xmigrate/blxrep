It acts as a central collector for replicating disk data from multiple servers. It requires a data directory and policy directory to be specified.

Policy directory is used to specify the policy for the disk backups for each agent.</p>"},{"location":"#agent-mode","title":"Agent Mode","text":"<p>In agent mode, blxrep runs on individual servers to send snapshot backups and live changes to the dispatcher. It requires an agent ID, dispatcher address, and device to be specified. We need the agent ID to be unique if we are connecting multiple servers to the same dispatcher.

It is a terminal UI library for Go that is easy to use and highly customizable. With TUI mode, you can navigate throught the agents that are connected to the dispatcher and see the status of the disk backups. You can also mount the disk backups to any available point in time and restore the files or partitions with the help of the TUI.</p> <p>To start the TUI, use the <code>tui</code> command:</p> <pre><code>blxrep tui --data-dir=&lt;data_directory&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"architecture/","title":"Architecture","text":""},{"location":"architecture/#tech-stack","title":"Tech stack","text":"<p>We have chosen to use the following tech stack:</p> <ul> <li>Golang 1.23</li> <li>BoltDB</li> <li>eBPF</li> </ul> <p>We only have one code base for the Agent, Dispatcher and the TUI application.

This design enables both full disk backups and continuous incremental change tracking to operate simultaneously. When an Agent connects, it authenticates through a secure WebSocket connection and immediately begins two parallel processes: creating a complete disk image and monitoring disk sectors for changes. During the full backup process, the Agent streams disk data to the Dispatcher, which stores it as an .img file in the snapshot directory while tracking progress in the xmactions database. Simultaneously, the Agent monitors disk sectors for changes, sending these sector numbers to the Dispatcher through a dedicated WebSocket channel. The Dispatcher preserves these sector changes as .cst files in the incremental directory.</p> <p>At regular intervals defined by the live_sync_frequency, the Dispatcher reads the collected sector numbers and requests the corresponding data from the Agent. Upon receiving this data, the Dispatcher stores it in .bak files within the incremental directory, ensuring all changes are captured and preserved.</p> <p>In the current implementation, if network connectivity between the Agent and Dispatcher is interrupted, the Agent initiates a new full disk snapshot upon reconnection. While this approach ensures data consistency, it's not optimized for network efficiency or storage resources. We are actively exploring more efficient approaches that would capture only the incremental changes that occurred during the network downtime, alongside the existing live change sector tracking mechanism.</p> <p>This optimization would significantly reduce network bandwidth usage and backup time during reconnection scenarios. Instead of transferring the entire disk image again, the system would only need to synchronize the specific sectors that changed during the disconnection period. This enhancement would be particularly valuable in environments with unstable network connections or when dealing with large disk volumes.</p> <pre><code>sequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Agent\n    participant D as Dispatcher\n    participant XMA as xmactions DB\n    participant XMD as xmdispatcher DB\n    participant SNAP as /data-dir/snapshot\n    participant INC as /data-dir/incremental\n\n    A-&gt;&gt;+D: WS: /ws/config, /ws/snapshot, /ws/live, /ws/restore\n    A-&gt;&gt;D: Auth (secret)\n    D--&gt;&gt;-A: Auth Success\n    A-&gt;&gt;D: Footprint Data\n    D-&gt;&gt;XMD: Store Footprint\n\n    par Full Backup\n        A-&gt;&gt;A: Start disk clone\n        A-&gt;&gt;+D: Metadata (/ws/snapshot)\n        D-&gt;&gt;XMA: Create action\n        D--&gt;&gt;-A: ACK\n        loop Backup Progress\n            A-&gt;&gt;D: Disk chunks\n            D-&gt;&gt;XMA: Update progress\n            D-&gt;&gt;SNAP: Write .img file\n        end\n    and Change Monitor\n        A-&gt;&gt;A: Monitor sectors\n        loop On Changes\n            A-&gt;&gt;D: Changed sectors (/ws/live)\n            D-&gt;&gt;INC: Write sectors (.cst)\n        end\n    end\n\n    loop Live Sync (live_sync_frequency)\n        D-&gt;&gt;INC: Read .cst file\n        D-&gt;&gt;A: Request sector data\n        A-&gt;&gt;A: Read sectors\n        A-&gt;&gt;D: Send sector data\n        D-&gt;&gt;INC: Write .bak file\n    end</code></pre> <p>The architecture utilizes four distinct WebSocket endpoints:</p> <ul> <li>/ws/config for configuration management</li> <li>/ws/snapshot for full disk backup operations</li> <li>/ws/live for real-time change tracking</li> <li>/ws/restore for data restoration processes</li> </ul> <p>This separation of concerns allows for efficient handling of different types of operations while maintaining persistent connections between the Agent and Dispatcher.
